That it takes much purer heart and a guileless mind for one to have a sincere devotion, even at the beginner's level, for God/Avatar, than to jump right into the vedantic studies and analysis. I appreciated Sri Ramakrishna's message so much more. If people spent, in parallel,  even 10% of their vedantic practice time praying to and developing an affectionate relationship with Sri Ramakrishna, their progress will be remarkably faster. Sri Ramakrishna, is the REAL DEAL; you can take my word for this. I am going to work hard on keeping my mouth shut on the cult of Vivekananda. Jai Sriramakrishna, Jai Bhagwan.\",\n",
