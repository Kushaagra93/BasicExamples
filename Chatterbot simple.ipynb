    "Chatterbot is a python library specifically designed to generate chatbots. This algorithm uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to fabricate varying responses to users as per their requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatterbot makes it easier to develop chatbots that can engage in conversations. It starts by creating an untrained chatterbot that has no prior experience or knowledge regarding how to communicate. As the users enter statements, the library saves the request made by the user as well as it also saves the responses that are sent back to the users. As the number of instances increases in chatterbot, the accuracy of the responses made by chatterbot also increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatterbot is trained to search the closest analogous response by finding the closest analogous request made by users that is equivalent to the new request made. Then it selects a response from the already existing responses. The USP of chatterbot is that it enables developers to create their own dataset and structures at ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a Chatbot using Chatterbot\n",
    "Let's begin by installing the chatterbot library. For creating chatbot also need to install chatterbot corpus. Corpus - literal meaning is a collection of words. This contains a corpus of data that is included in the chatterbot module. Each corpus is nothing but a prototype of different input statements and their responses. These corpus are used by bots to train themselves. The most recommended method for installing chatterbot and chatterbot_corpus is by using pip."

Training a chatbot using chatterbot is as simple as providing a conversation into the chatbot database. As soon as the chatbot is given a dataset, it produces the essential entries in the chatbot's knowledge graph to represent the input and output in the right manner. Firstly, let's import the ListTrainer, create its object by passing the Chatbot object, and call the train() method by passing a list of sentences."
